                <ul>
                    <li>Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770.</li>
                    <li>He begins playing the piano early on in his life.</li>
                    <li>At 16 year old Beethoven meets Mozart in Vienna.</li>
                    <li>In 1800, Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 premiers at the Vienna Burgtheater.</li>
                    <li>In 1802, Beethoven moves to the Austrian village Heiligenstadt where he wrote parts of his
                        Second and Third Symphonies.</li>
                    <li>Beethoven was a supporter of the French Revolution in 1798 and Napoleon Bonaparte at the time.
                    </li>
                    <li>The world premiers of Symphonies No 5 and 6 were conducted in 1808. Author E.T.A. Hoffman wrote
                        "Beethoven’s music moves the lever controlling horror, fear, dread, pain and awakens that
                        infinite longing that is the
                        essence of Romanticism'</li>
                    <li>Musicians playing Symphony No. 7 and the Battle Symphony at it's premier in 1813 felt that
                        Beethoven's music was hard to
                        play.</li>
                    <li>In 1815, Beethoven becomes joint guardian of his brother's son Karl. He did not see eye to eye
                        with Karl's mother Johanna.</li>
                    <li> In 1821, Beethoven was arrested as he got lost during a walk and was unrecognisable to police.
                    </li>
                    <li>In March 1827, Beethoven passed away. Around 20,000 people attended his funeral.</li>

                <p>“To play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable.”</p>
                <p>“Don't only practice your art, but force your way into its secrets, for it and
                    knowledge can raise
                    men to the divine.”</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Beethoven composed around 750 pieces during his lifetime.</li>
                    <li>His Symphony No. 3 <i>"Eroica"</i> was originally dedicated to Napoleon. When Napoleon declared
                        himself emperor, Beethoven erased his name and dedicated the sumphony to "the memory of a great
                        man".
                    </li>
                    <li>From the age of 26, Beethoven had problems hearing; for the last 7 years of his life he was
                        almost entirely deaf while still composing music.</li>
                    <li>Ludwig van Beethoven never learned how to multiply or divide.</li>
                    <li>He was a daydreamer "“I was just occupied with such a lovely, deep thought, I couldn’t bear to
                        be disturbed.”</li>
